    <p><span class="italic">“I am called of God. My authority is above that of the kings of the earth. By revelation I have been selected as a personal
	representative of the Lord Jesus Christ. He is my Master and he has chosen me to represent him. To stand in his place, to say and 
	do what he himself would say and do if he personally were ministering to the very people to whom he has sent me. My voice is his 
	voice, and my acts are his acts; my words are his words and my doctrine is his doctrine. My commission is to do what he wants done. 
	To say what he wants said. To be a living modern witness in word and deed of the divinity of his great and marvelous latter-day work.”</span>
