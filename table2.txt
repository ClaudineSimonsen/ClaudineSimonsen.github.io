	    The work has been wonderful! This week I had the special opportunity to go to the temple 
	    with a recent convert, Daniel.  How amazing is that? I am so lucky I could go. My companion, 
	    Sister Jensen was able to teach and baptize him. Daniel has more faith than just about 
	    anyone I know! Its incredible!</td>

		<td>The Lord puts you where He needs you!<br><br>
	    We were contacting people in the neighborhood and decided to change the direction 
		we were going. We didn't think much of it. We were walking towards an investigators 
		house who was difficult to get a hold of but I thought that we should try to see if 
		he was home. As we got closer to his house we saw smoke coming out of his windows. 
		We walked up to the door and I looked in and saw flames all over inside his house! 
		I couldn't believe my eyes! We quickly called the police, found our investigator, 
		and got away from the house. The police and firemen showed up and got everything 
		under control. No one was hurt!  I am truly grateful the Lord changed our plans and 
		directed us where were needed most.</td>

		Big announcement...Matt was baptized!!! It was an amazing day! The joy this gospel 
	    brings is incredible. It was so cool to be apart of his conversion and his decision to 
	    be baptized. He is a great guy.</td>

		<td>Rajani is getting baptized!<br><br>
	    The first thing Rajani said when she walked out of the font was, &quot;I feel so peaceful!&quot; 
	    It made my heart melt. She has such a strong testimony. We have become close friends, 
	    it's amazing how much love you can have for someone when that love begins with the Savior 
	    Jesus Christ.</td>

	    Nick, my very dear friend, is preparing for baptism on the 20th! I am so excited for him! 
	    Sadly though, I'm going to miss his baptism...I'm being transfered to Lamar, Coloardo.  
	    Thank goodness for the miracle of technology, however, that allowed me to attend his baptism 
		despite the distance! Nick's baptism made my whole mission basically! There isn't anything more 
	    wonderful than seeing someone following the example of our Savior and Redeemer!</tr>

		<td>I've got the Ghost!<br><br>
	    Everything turned out great for Shirley's baptism! Shirley was an investigator who Sister Hoeppner 
		taught for just a couple weeks before I came to Lamar. She was very closed off and not open to 
		join at first, but over time her heart has been softened by the spirit. Shirley accepted the 
		invitation to be baptized and was confirmed a member of the church.  It was a sweet experience. 
		We went to visit her that night and she proclaimed, "I've got the ghost!" Shirley is so happy and 
		so grateful for the gospel. It has brought a lot of happiness to her life, and it's easy to see it.</td>
